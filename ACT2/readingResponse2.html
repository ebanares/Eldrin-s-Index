	<h2><a rel="next" href="https://www.are.na/blog/the-poetry-of-tools">The Poetry of Tools</a></h2>
	<p class="question">1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</p>
	<p class="answers">In a literal sense, I think what Seu means is for the viewer to let go of the familiar physical motions we make when using the tools we have,  such as a laptop or phone. She wants us to let go of the automated, muscle memory actions we’re so used to and actually think of what these tools can do. These tools then become poetic because we’re thinking about them beyond their functional use. The taxonomy of tool poetics she displayed are all examples that use the computer’s/internet’s functions to create art, or other works.</p>

	<p class="question">2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</p>
	<p class="answers">'Performing Data' is taking a set of data and refurbishing its functional purpose into something that has conceptual meaning. For example, in Seu’s post she showed Jörg Piringer’s Unicode which takes all of Unicode’s characters and displays it as fast as possible. Showing each encoded character frame-by-frame over the course of half an hour displays how many characters there are encoded. I interpret that sheer scale as a record of written language in a digital medium. Similarly, an example I discovered is <a rel="next" href="https://boniver.withspotify.com/">https://boniver.withspotify.com/</a>. This is a website that showcases how many people on Spotify are streaming Bon Iver's new album 'i,i' using only 'i,i'. This website also allows the viewer to see the album's day to day statistics about when and where a specific song from the album is trending. To me, this operates within 'Performing Data' as the website takes data found on Spotify and visualizes it interactively.</p>
