		<h2>Turing Complete User</h2>
		<p class="question">1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?</p>
		<p class="answers">The word “user” is inherently attached to the idea of a physical computer interface, which recent interface designers, like Don Norman, wishes to make invisible (or at least, appear to be invisible). For this reason, the field of Interface Design is renaming itself to Experience Design, with the goal of making users forget that clunky computers with buttons and interfaces exist. Although Liliana understands the great potential invisible computers bring, she is opposed to eliminating the word "users". She wants to protect and preserve the existence of "users" as taking away the word, and replacing it with “people”, removes the distinction between developers and users. In doing so, the rights of whatever users want to do on their own personal devices can be taken away from them.</p>

		<p class="question">2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</p>
		<p class="answers">Lialina’s ideal internet user is known as the General Purpose User, or Turing Complete User. This user is like  Alan Turing's idea of a computer, one that, given enough time and memory, can perform any task they set their mind to.  Lialina outlines that these users can achieve what they want to do regardless of the intended purpose of an application or device. For example, users who can use their webcam as a mirror, not just to take pictures or communicate with other people. Or users who choose not to use an application like Twitter to publish their thoughts, opinions, and discuss with other users, but on a website of their own.</p>

		<p class="question">3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</p>
		<p class="answers">An example of a gap that needed to be filled by users, in this case myself, was the act of sending money to another bank account through Interac e-Tansfer. In order to use the function and send money, I would first have to choose which account the money would come from. I would then type in the amount of money I want to send in a dedicated text box. Finally, after a few other steps, the online bank would usually ask me to choose a security question, and write an answer only for the recipient, in order for them to safely receive the money I sent. All these instances, with the goal to send money, are examples that require the user to fill in and interact with the website of the online bank.</p>
