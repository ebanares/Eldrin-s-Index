	<p class="question">1. Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</p>
	<p class="answers">Schwulst advocates for individual websites over social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat, because these platforms are controlled by faceless corporations whose main priority aren’t the users they have. Instead, their primary goal, like any business, is to make a profit. Looking at it in this context, I would have to agree, to an extent, as I personally wouldn’t want these corporations to have any more control over my life than they already have. Having a personal, individual website means that a user can generally have complete control and expression in that domain. This allows creativity and freedom. However, my only counter-argument is that because these websites/applications are almost-universally available and has a global outreach, it is nice to have in order to connect to large groups of people.</p>
	<p class="question">2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here.</p>
