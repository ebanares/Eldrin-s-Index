			<p class="textBox two">Everyone loves pizza. I don't think I know anyone who doesn't love pizza. What's great about pizza is that you can put <strong>WHATEVER</strong> topping you want on it. Pepperoni? Classic. Cheese? Lots! Mushrooms? Nice. Pineapple? Hey, that's up to you, buddy. Any pizza, good or bad, can be customized to your own taste. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The thing about pizza is that you have to consume it. The most perfect-looking pizza will eventually go bad after a while. You gotta eat it when it's good. And after that, it's gone. But that's fine! You can always get/make another one.</p>
