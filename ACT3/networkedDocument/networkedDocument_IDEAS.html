		<h1>What i want to do</h1>
		<p>
			1. Reference library for music. You type in a letter, or get it randomized, and a random music genre that starts with that letter will appear. You get the chance to listen to a sample of that genre and/or type in a new letter. Beyond typing, you can choose to look through the <strong>whole</strong> list of music genres.
			<br>
			<br>
			2. Map that tracks the characters' journey across the world in the book <i>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea</i>, written by Jules Verne. Here's the catch, I haven't actually finished the book yet. I only know up to a certain extent, which means this website will always be unfinished (until I finish the book). In a way, it can not only be a documentation of the character's travels, but also a documentation of where I am in the book.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Recap</strong>
			<li>Website that maps characters's journey in the story</li>
			<li>Website that logs when I read/when I stop reading</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			3. Day in the Life of Tuna Banares. Basically, a documentation of my cat's life in a day, similar to Jonathan Harris' 'The Whale Hunt'.
